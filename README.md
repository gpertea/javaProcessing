# javaTeach
Small projects I used for teaching kids (teenagers+) programming, using Java; I used the Processing library at first, to make it as visual as possible (and even code some simple interactive games) but they complained it's too complex (?) to also learn about the graphical functions and overall too hard/too much information to absorb (yeah right, the instant-gratification generation ?). So now the later projects here are using mostly plain Java..
